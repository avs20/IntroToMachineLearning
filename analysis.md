# Identifying Persons of Interest from Enron email dataset 
by :- Ashutosh Singh

## Introduction 



## Data Exploration

#### Some View about the data and following points 
 total number of data points
 allocation across classes (POI/non-POI)
 number of features
 are there features with many missing values? etc.

#### Outlier Investigation
Find the outliers in the features
how they handled 
retained or removed
## Feature Selection/Model Building

#### Feature Creation
At least one new feature is implemented. Justification for that feature is provided in the written response, and the effect of that feature on the final algorithm performance is tested.

#### Feature Selection 
Univariate or recursive feature selection is deployed, or features are selected by hand (different combinations of features are attempted, and the performance is documented for each one). Features that are selected are reported and the number of features selected is justified. For an algorithm that supports getting the feature importances (e.g. decision tree) or feature scores (e.g. SelectKBest), those are documented as well.

#### Feature Scaling
Scale the features / normalization


## Algorithms

#### Testing Algorithms 
Test atleast 5 algorithms and pick the result 

#### Tuning
At least one important parameter tuned, with at least 3 settings investigated systematically, or any of the following are true:
GridSearchCV used for parameter tuning
Several parameters tuned
Parameter tuning incorporated into algorithm selection (i.e. parameters tuned for more than one algorithm, and best algorithm-tune combination selected for final analysis)

## Validation and Evaluation

#### Usage of Evaluation Metrics
Use of accuracy, precision ,recall 

#### Validation 
Testing and splitting data 

#### Performance 
Results of the tester.py

## Reflection
Talk about the what is learned and how the problem is handled. What the results siginify.
